/**
 * @brief Level of detail for an entity's mesh, by distance or by how much of
 * the screen the entity covers.
 *
 * LodSystem picks the first level whose mesh exists and whose range still
 * covers the entity's distance to the main camera, writes it to
 * MeshComponent::meshID, and hides the entity (MeshComponent::visible = false)
 * once it is beyond every level. Give the entity a MeshComponent as usual;
 * its meshID is overwritten by the system.
 *
 * `mesh[k]` is a mesh handle from AssetManager::getMeshID, or 0 for "no mesh
 * at this level" (e.g. small props that simply disappear far away, or parts
 * that only exist up close). `distance[k]` is the range of level k in metres;
 * level 0 is the most detailed. Levels must be listed nearest first.
 *
 * Screen-height mode: set `size` (> 0) and the levels are chosen by how tall
 * the entity looks on screen instead of by metres. The entity's height on
 * screen, as a fraction of the screen's, is
 *
 *     size * max(|scale|) / (2 * distance * tan(fov / 2))
 *
 * (`size` is the object's extent in model space, its scale applied on top, and
 * `fov` is the main camera's vertical field of view). Level k is used while
 * that fraction is at least `screenHeight[k]`; give the levels nearest first,
 * so the thresholds fall (0.3, 0.1, 0.02...). A threshold of 0 never gives up,
 * so the last level can stay visible at any distance; a level with a positive
 * threshold hides the entity once it shrinks below it. The result does not
 * depend on the window's resolution, and bigger objects hold their detail
 * further away than small ones. lodScreenHeight() converts a distance you have
 * in mind into a threshold.
 *
 * Entities that make up one object (a tree's trunk and leaves) switch
 * together as long as they share a position and ranges (and, in screen-height
 * mode, a size and scale).
