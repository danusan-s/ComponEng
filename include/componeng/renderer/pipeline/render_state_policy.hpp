/**
 * @brief The pipeline state a pass draws with. This is the one place that says
 * what each pass does to culling, depth and blending, so changing a pass's
 * behaviour does not mean reading the draw loop.
 *
 * `material` is the state the batch's material asked for. How much of it a
 * pass honours differs:
 *  - DepthPrepass: only its culling; the rest is fixed (depth in, no colour).
 *  - Opaque:       only its culling. Depth is writable, or after a pre-pass
 *                  read-only and tested for equality, so that only the nearest
 *                  surface of each pixel is shaded.
 *  - Sky:          none of it; ignored.
 *  - Transparent:  all of it (blending, depth write, culling).
 *
 * `depthPrepassed` says the depth buffer already holds the opaque surfaces.
